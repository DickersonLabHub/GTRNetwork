# Note:
#  For database purposes only, an operon is, one or more contiguous genes transcribed in the same direction.
#  Please note that, according to this definition, an operon must contain a promoter upstream of all genes and a terminator downstream.
#  It is also relatively common to find operons with several promoters, some of them internally located, thus, transcribing a partial group of genes.
#  In all cases so far, one gene belongs to only one operon.
# Columns:
#	(1) Operon name
#	(2) Number of genes contained in the operon
#	(3) DNA strand where the operon is coded
#	(4) Name/Blattner number (bnumber) of the gene(s) contained in the operon
#	(5) Evidences that support the existence of the operon's TUs
