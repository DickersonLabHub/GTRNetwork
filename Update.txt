GTRNetwork 1.2 Update (Dec. 2010) by Fu, Yao (Al)
Directed TFA and links
1. After calculating the value of TFA change, DirectTFA can predict the TFA change direction
2. DirectLinks function use Directed TFA and gene exprssion data to predict regulatory direction of regulatory links
3. GTRNetwork main code integrated DirectTFA and DirectLinks functions so the preidction have biological meaningful link directions

Update to fit the RegulonDB 7.0 data
1. load functions modified to fit RegulonDB 7.0
2. Output data structure of Autotest and AutotestS are changed to fit large scale output data
3. Use function E2R instead of log2ratio to prepare log2 ratio of expression data.
